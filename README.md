# EnDecrypt
A simple text encryptor and decryptor. This program enables you to encrypt any text that you input to encrypted text, and revert the encrypted text by this encriptor to the original text. This encryptor use the fully custom made text scrambler/encryption algorithm, that I made.

This program was built with Visual Studio 2017 Community, with .NET Framework.

Take a peek at the "EnDecrypt" folder, for the project's source code. If you want to test the result only, simply run the .exe file inside the "0. Output" folder, use the .docx file for input text example, and have fun :)
